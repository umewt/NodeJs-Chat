# NodeJs-Chat-MultipleClients
Basic NodeJS chat using core Node Components, supports multiple clients.
Note: Also has underscore as an dependency, can easily be removed (possible added branch -> no underscore)

Change the port, ip in app.js files on both server and client directory to use on different ports or perhaps allow external connections.

To run, with default : (Localhost, port 30000)

    git clone https://github.com/umewt/NodeJs-Chat/
    (Or download directory as .zip and extract where you please)
    cd NodeJs-Chat/Server
    npm install
    node app.js
    (Open another console)
    cd NodeJs-Chat/Client
    node app.js
    (For multiple Clients you may rerun node app.js)
